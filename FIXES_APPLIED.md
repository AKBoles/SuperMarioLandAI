# Mario AI Training - Fixes Applied

## Overview
The original Mario AI training program had several critical issues that prevented it from working with the current version of PyBoy (v2.x). This document outlines all the fixes that were applied to make it functional.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PyBoy API Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: The code was written for PyBoy v1.x but PyBoy v2.x has breaking API changes.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Import Fix**: Changed `from pyboy import WindowEvent` to `from pyboy.utils import WindowEvent`
- **Initialization Fix**: Updated `PyBoy('SuperMarioLand.gb', game_wrapper=True, window_type="headless")` to `PyBoy(ROM_PATH, window='null', sound_emulated=False)`
- **Memory Access Fix**: Changed `pyboy.get_memory_value()` to `pyboy.memory[]` syntax
- **Game Wrapper Usage**: Updated to use proper game wrapper initialization with `pyboy.game_wrapper.start_game()`

### 2. Neural Network Structure Issues

**Problem**: The original neural network implementation had inconsistencies and outdated PyTorch usage.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Simplified Architecture**: Created a clean feedforward network with proper layer definitions
- **Input/Output Sizing**: Fixed input size (400) to match flattened game area and output size (9) for action space
- **Forward Pass**: Implemented proper forward pass with ReLU activations
- **Action Selection**: Added `get_action()` method for clean action selection

### 3. Genetic Algorithm Issues

**Problem**: The genetic algorithm had poor structure and was tightly coupled to deprecated APIs.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Population Class**: Redesigned with proper genome management
- **Selection**: Implemented tournament selection for better diversity
- **Crossover**: Added uniform crossover across network parameters
- **Mutation**: Improved mutation with proper noise addition
- **Elitism**: Maintained top performers across generations

### 4. Control System Issues

**Problem**: Action mapping was incomplete and didn't use proper PyBoy controls.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Action Space**: Expanded to 9 actions including combinations (right+jump, left+run, etc.)
- **Control Mapping**: Created `mario_controls()` function with proper WindowEvent mappings
- **Input Handling**: Added proper button press/release sequences

### 5. Multiprocessing Issues

**Problem**: Creating multiple PyBoy instances simultaneously caused resource conflicts.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Process Limiting**: Limited concurrent processes to avoid conflicts
- **Timeout Handling**: Added timeout for genome evaluation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensured proper PyBoy instance cleanup after evaluation
- **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for failed evaluations

### 6. Fitness Function Issues

**Problem**: Fitness calculation was overly simplistic and prone to errors.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Memory-Based Fitness**: Used Mario's X position from memory for progress tracking
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added fallback fitness calculation when memory access fails
- **Fitness Smoothing**: Prevented fitness from decreasing drastically between evaluations

### 7. Code Structure Issues

**Problem**: Code was disorganized with poor separation of concerns.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Modularization**: Better separation between genetic algorithm, neural network, and utility functions
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Documentation**: Added proper docstrings and comments
- **Type Safety**: Improved input validation and type checking

## Files Modified

### `mario.py`
- Complete rewrite of main training loop
- Fixed PyBoy initialization and API usage
- Improved multiprocessing implementation
- Added proper error handling and logging

### `core/genetic_algorithm.py`
- Redesigned Network class with proper PyTorch structure
- Implemented new Population class with modern genetic operators
- Fixed action selection and network evaluation
- Added genome management and evolution logic

### `core/utils.py`
- Fixed WindowEvent import
- Updated memory access methods
- Added new utility functions for Mario position and fitness
- Implemented proper control mapping

### `test_mario_setup.py` (NEW)
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Validates all components work correctly
- Provides setup instructions
- Tests without requiring ROM file

### `FIXES_APPLIED.md` (NEW)
- Documents all changes made
- Provides troubleshooting guide
- Explains the training process

## How It Works Now

1. **Initialization**: Creates a population of neural networks
2. **Evaluation**: Each network controls Mario for a limited time
3. **Fitness**: Networks are scored based on how far Mario progresses
4. **Selection**: Best performing networks are selected for breeding
5. **Evolution**: Next generation is created through crossover and mutation
6. **Iteration**: Process repeats for multiple generations

## Requirements to Run

1. **ROM File**: Place `SuperMarioLand.gb` in the project directory
2. **Dependencies**: PyBoy, PyTorch, NumPy (already installed)
3. **Legal Compliance**: Only use ROM files you legally own

## Usage

1. **Test Setup**: `python3 test_mario_setup.py`
2. **Start Training**: `python3 mario.py` (requires ROM file)
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch console output for generation statistics

## Expected Behavior

- **Generation 0**: Random behavior, low fitness scores
- **Early Generations**: Gradual improvement in movement
- **Later Generations**: More sophisticated strategies emerge
- **Convergence**: Eventually learns to navigate obstacles and enemies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **ROM Not Found**: Ensure `SuperMarioLand.gb` is in the correct directory
2. **Memory Errors**: Try reducing population size or process count
3. **Slow Performance**: Adjust `max_steps` in evaluation function
4. **Stagnation**: Increase mutation rate or add more diversity

### Performance Tuning:
- Adjust `population_size` (default: 20)
- Modify `max_steps` (default: 1000)
- Change `num_processes` based on CPU cores
- Tune genetic algorithm parameters

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Fitness**: Include score, time, and enemy defeat bonuses
2. **Memory Optimization**: Better memory address detection for different games
3. **Visualization**: Add real-time training visualization
4. **Save/Load**: Implement model checkpointing
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated parameter optimization
